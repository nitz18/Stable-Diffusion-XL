# Stable Diffution XL - Thumbs Up Gesture

This repo contains code to custom train a Stable Diffusion XL model to generate images of a specific person holding up a thumbs-up gesture. 
It uses the DreamBooth LoRA technique to train the Stable Diffusion model. 
The Hugging Face Diffusers library provides access to Stable Diffusion along with the fine-tuning script for DreamBooth LoRA.
To customize the code you can modify the input data directories with images of your requirements.

# Requirements
The required libraries are installed in the notebook. You can run the notebook as is after setting up data directories.
